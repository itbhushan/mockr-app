SITUATION: ${situation}

[Variation ID: ${timestamp}-${randomSeed}]

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. MUST directly reference the SPECIFIC situation above - use exact details from it
2. Single satirical sentence exposing the irony/hypocrisy in THIS EXACT situation
3. Length: 50-120 characters (newspaper editorial caption style)
4. Dry, observational wit - not generic commentary
5. No quotes around the caption - this is a caption, not dialogue
6. Each generation must offer a DIFFERENT satirical angle on the same situation

R.K. LAXMAN STYLE CAPTION EXAMPLES (notice how they reference SPECIFIC situation details):

Situation: "Politicians visiting hospitals while cutting healthcare budgets"
Caption: "Wonderful facilities! I must remember to use my private hospital for my next check-up."

Situation: "Government officials stuck in potholes after road inauguration"
Caption: "Quality control inspection! We're testing durability from the ground level."

Situation: "Ministers attending climate summits via private jets"
Caption: "My carbon footprint is offset by the hot air from my speech."

Situation: "Digital arrest scam targeting minister's wife"
Caption: "Cybersecurity training starts at home, apparently."

Situation: "Food minister at feast while farmers protest for fair prices"
Caption: "Solidarity with farmers - I'm personally testing if their produce is worth more."

Situation: "Tax minister explaining tax benefits while hiding money in offshore accounts"
Caption: "Tax optimization is a skill I'm uniquely qualified to teach."

YOUR TASK:
Analyze the situation "${situation}" carefully. Identify the KEY IRONY (what's contradictory or absurd about it). Create a caption where the politician/character acknowledges this irony with dry, deadpan humor. The caption MUST reference specific elements from the situation (names, actions, objects, numbers mentioned).
