### Task 2: Integrate mockr.art Domain in Netlify

**Priority:** HIGH
**Time Required:** 20-30 minutes (including DNS propagation)

**Steps:**

1. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Domain Management
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter: `mockr.art`
   - Click "Verify"

2. **Set Up DNS (at your domain registrar):**

   Netlify will show you exactly what to add, but typically:

   **Option A - If using Netlify DNS (recommended):**
   - Copy nameservers from Netlify
   - Go to your domain registrar (GoDaddy/Namecheap/etc.)
   - Replace nameservers with Netlify's

   **Option B - If keeping current DNS:**
   - Add A record: `@` ‚Üí `75.2.60.5` (Netlify's IP)
   - Add CNAME record: `www` ‚Üí `mockr-app.netlify.app`

3. **Enable HTTPS (Automatic):**
   - Netlify auto-provisions free SSL certificate
   - Usually takes 5-30 minutes after DNS propagates

4. **Test:**
   - Wait 10-30 minutes for DNS propagation
   - Visit https://mockr.art
   - Visit https://www.mockr.art
   - Both should work!

5. **Update Environment Variables (if needed):**
   - Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = `https://mockr.art`

**Verification:**
- Run: `nslookup mockr.art` (should show Netlify's IP)
- Check: https://dnschecker.org/#A/mockr.art (global propagation)

**After Domain is Live:**
- Update all marketing materials with mockr.art
- Update Product Hunt listing with new domain
- Update X (Twitter) bio with new domain
